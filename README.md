# Intro

Hello! Here you'll find all the source code of David Blocks (which is unofficial), a sorta parody to old Roblox revivals I guess, don't know, the lore is set to be 1996 or something, like worlds.com where it ran off using a doom engine.

there are only 2 types of files in this project

1. rbxl (Roblox Place file)
2. rbxlx (Roblox Place XML file)

If you download Roblox games with the sole purpose of editing them in the studio to make them look yours to see if you probably get visits, you most likely know what file number 1 is.

that's it
